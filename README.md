### Study tool for learning how to read and write the 46 basic hiragana characters
The study tool centers around the concept of a deck of cards. You start out with five kana cards in your reading and writing decks: A, I, U, E, and O. You can add or remove cards from your reading and writing decks as you progress. Your progress with each card can be viewed in the **EDIT READ DECK** and **EDIT WRITE DECK** screens. When you are ready to study, choose **PRACTICE READING** or **PRACTICE WRITING**. The cart does not check your work automatically, and instead it is up to you while studying to follow the instructions and be honest about your attempts. The cart will remember your last 10 attempts with each card and your progress bar will fill as you get closer to having 10 successful reads out of 10 or 10 successful writes out of 10.

When it comes to writing, the default controls can be tricky, but if you are familiar with [Shodo](https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=2033), it is very similar. Many thanks to Ryosuke Mihara for his inspirational cart!

Thank you for checking out my cart, and happy studying!
